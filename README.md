**`Digital Craftsman (Software Engineer & Lifelong Learner)`**


Driven by an unwavering commitment to personal growth and a passion for technology, I have never missed a day of coding since embarking on my journey. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, C#, and TypeScript, I have honed my skills in front-end development using React, and I‚Äôm now diving deeper into backend development, leveraging technologies like MongoDB and Mongoose.

I am currently working on several exciting projects, including developing a backend API for a forum, tied to a site already deployed on Render, and a household management application that features an intuitive invite system. As I continue to build my expertise, I am also expanding my technical repertoire by learning C++.

My journey is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about applying it meaningfully. From exploring the world of cybersecurity with the goal of becoming a secure backend engineer to creating impactful solutions, I am driven by the thrill of problem-solving and innovation.

I believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and teams who share a passion for creating impactful solutions.
