# üî≠ Brian Monestime 

**`Digital Artisan (Software Engineer & Lifelong Learner)`**


Driven by an unwavering commitment to personal growth and a passion for technology, I have never missed a day of coding since embarking on my journey. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, C#, and TypeScript, I have honed my skills in front-end development using React, and I‚Äôm now diving deeper into backend development, leveraging technologies like MongoDB and Mongoose.

I am currently working on several exciting projects, including developing a backend API for a forum, tied to a site already deployed on Render, and a household management application that features an intuitive invite system. As I continue to build my expertise, I am also expanding my technical repertoire by learning C++.

My journey is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about applying it meaningfully. From exploring the world of cybersecurity with the goal of becoming a secure backend engineer to creating impactful solutions, I am driven by the thrill of problem-solving and innovation.

I believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and teams who share a passion for creating impactful solutions.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Brian's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 My Journey: From Inspiration to Innovation

It all started with a spark of inspiration from an unexpected source‚Äîa movie called Hackers and a character known as Zero Cool. For me, this was more than just a film; it was a glimpse into a world where code could shape reality. The idea that I could communicate with machines, bend them to my will, and create something from nothing captivated me. That day, a seed was planted.

As the years went by, moving from Florida to Utah, the world of technology kept calling to me. Eventually, I decided to answer that call. With determination, I dove headfirst into the world of coding, making a promise to myself: I would never let a day pass without learning something new.

I began my journey with JavaScript, and as the lines of code started to make sense, a whole new universe opened up. The possibilities seemed endless, and my curiosity drove me deeper. I learned the basics of C#, explored TypeScript, and embraced the power of React. With every project, every bug I fixed, and every feature I built, my skills grew, and so did my passion.

But it wasn‚Äôt just about the code. I saw the potential to build something meaningful, something that could help others. That‚Äôs why I started working on a household management application‚Äîa tool designed to bring simplicity and organization to everyday life. The invite system I‚Äôm developing will be the heart of the application, allowing users to create shared spaces with ease.

At the same time, I began developing a backend API for a forum, a side project with hopes of making it open-source for others to use as well. It was a challenging endeavor, but one I approached with the same relentless drive that had guided me from the start. I chose MongoDB for the database, knowing it was the right tool to bring my vision to life.

But my journey didn‚Äôt stop there. Always eager to learn, I recently began exploring C++, a language that promises to unlock even more possibilities. I know that the more I learn, the more I can create, and the more I can give back to the world that has given me so much.

As my coding journey continues, I remain committed to growth, collaboration, and innovation. With every new skill I acquire and every project I complete, I‚Äôm not just writing code‚ÄîI‚Äôm writing my story. A story of perseverance, passion, and the endless pursuit of knowledge.
